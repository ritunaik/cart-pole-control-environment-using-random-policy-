# CartPole Gym Environment Exploration using random policy

This Python script explores the OpenAI Gym environment "CartPole-v1" using the Gymnasium library. It demonstrates how to interact with the CartPole environment, render it for visualization, and perform random actions in the environment. Additionally, it includes code for running episodes and tracking the cumulative return.

## About the Code

The code accomplishes the following tasks:

1. Initializes the CartPole environment with human rendering.
2. Resets the environment to its initial state and renders it.
3. Prints information about the observation space (continuous) and action space.
4. Runs multiple episodes, each with a defined number of timesteps.
5. Within each episode, it randomly selects actions and takes steps in the environment.
6. Calculates and prints the cumulative return for each episode.
7. Resets the environment when an episode is done.
8. Displays the environment for visualization purposes.

## How to Use: 

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Install the Gymnasium library using pip : 
   ```bash
   pip install gymnasium
